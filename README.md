## Introduction
This is a code repository for a web video chat application that displays information about the video chat application and provides information about the video chat application itself and its associated documentation. The video chat application was created using the following technologies: React, JavaScript, and Material UI Design. The user template for the video chat application was provided by Javascript Mastery.

I built and deployed this interactive React Video Chat Application using WebRTC.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
